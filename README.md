HeroForge-OnceAgain
==============

HeroForge-OnceAgain is a character sheet creation software for D&D 3.5. 
It makes the character generation process much simpler, allowing you to create in minutes what previously took hours, and in hours what previously took days! 
Powerful and well-designed, it is based on the design of my dear Heliomance, the famous HeroForge-Anew. 
Thanks to this project done in excel, I had the inspiration to redo it in C# Windows Forms, in this way we gained in performance and in ease of alteration, allowing anyone to help with translations, inclusion of material, etc. 
It still has most of the official 3.5 content already released, and more content is being added. Give it a try and never look back!

## WANT TO HELP THIS PROJECT?
There are some needs, such as translation into other languages.
Also, with support for Wild Shape and animal companions, it would be really nice if I could get some help with data entry to add the stats for more creatures.
Right now, the list of creatures available to transform into is pretty limited, and there's almost nothing that isn't an animal - so the Masters of Many Forms are sad. Anyone willing to help with this, message me and I'll walk you through what's needed and how to get it done.
